new additions needed
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

bug with destroyable blocks

add restart and controls to pause screen

add You Died screen

add About screen

give enemies (dynamic??) flinching/destroy animation (something diff than the player blinking)
	- a custom shader should work

controller support
	- buy controllers - see above

MORE TESTING BEFORE MOVING FORWARD ON DIFF PLATFORMS FOR OPTIMIZATION WHERE NEEDED

more bosses/enemies
	- (insert random creativity after creating bosses...for levels layout/colors etc)

more weapons
	- sword (power up shoots force wave)
	- crazy power-ups only usable on bosses with full screen animations

more secondary items
	- bombs (can be thown)

more levels
	- work on laying out the world to build up the levels for the entire game
	- plan out the levels, enemies, progression

refine the controls screen - add translated text where needed

need to proguard the project

be sure that as much as possible is tracked in GameAnalytics (ongoing)


neat to haves
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

add Google Play Services & Steam Services based on build type (this should be do-able actually without too much effort - at least google)
	- login
	- logout
	- game saves
	- high scores
	- achievements

dynamic levels or placed blocks and enemies based on player progression
	- if the player has been to a certain stage in the game (loaded from game.sav) areas of a map can change slightly
	- this would be certain layers in the tiled maps being shown
	- if player already entered room and comes back at a certain point, show a specific layer containg items, doors, blocks, etc

add new screens
	- inventory (this might be doable based on new screen designs)
	- choose game save slot

costumes? (this is not going in this game)
	- raptor
	- taco
	- mech

add a power up for jumping
add barking ability
add a power up for barking

add barking ability for ghosts (the most basic attack)
	- phantoms run away when gizmo barks

gizmo starts off as a small dog, but soon gets a power up that make him slightly bigger and standing on two legs

Noir type game
shadow monsters
other underground enemies
metroid/mario/zelda

Gizmo is on a search for his lost brother. The last he had seen him, he was digging a hole in the forest. Gizmo enters the same hole that his brother did in an attempt to find him. Now Gizmo has found himself going deeper and deeper into the underground dungeons beneath the forest in order to find his brother.

Layer after layer of dungeons take Gizmo up against crazier and crazier enemeies. He finds power ups and loot along the way to let him keep going in his journey.

Every now and then, Gizmo finds a clue that lets him know that his brother went the same way that he is going.

At the end of the game, something tragic happens, but, Gizmo awakes to find that everything was just a dream. His brother is safely sleeping next to him. He falls back asleep.
